    <p>
     Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, born 15 September 1977, is a Nigerian writer whose works range from novels to short stories to nonfiction. She was described in The Times Literary Supplement as "the most prominent" of a "procession of critically acclaimed young anglophone authors [which] is succeeding in attracting a new generation of readers to African literature", particularly in her second home, the United States.</br>

<br>Adichie, a feminist, has written the novels: "Purple Hibiscus" (2003), "Half of a Yellow Sun" (2006), and "Americanah" (2013), the short-story collection "The Thing Around Your Neck" (2009), and the book-length essay "We Should All Be Feminists" (2014). Her most recent book, "Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions," was published in March 2017. In 2008, she was awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant.<br> 
<h3>Personal Life and Education</h3>
<p>Adichie was born in the city of Enugu in Nigeria, and grew up as the fifth of six children in an Igbo family in the university town of Nsukka in Enugu State. While she was growing up, her father, James Nwoye Adichie, worked as a professor of statistics at the University of Nigeria. Her mother, Grace Ifeoma, was the university's first female registrar. The family lost almost everything during the Nigerian Civil War, including both maternal and paternal grandfathers. Her family's ancestral village is in Abba in Anambra State.</br>
    

<br>Adichie completed her secondary education at the University of Nigeria Secondary School, Nsukka, where she received several academic prizes. She studied medicine and pharmacy at the University of Nigeria for a year and a half. During this period, she edited The Compass, a magazine run by the university's Catholic medical students. At the age of 19, Adichie left Nigeria for the United States to study Communications and Political Science at Drexel University in Philadelphia. She soon transferred to Eastern Connecticut State University to be near her sister Uche, who had a medical practice in Coventry, Connecticut. While the novelist was growing up in Nigeria, she was not used to being identified by the colour of her skin which suddenly changed when she arrived in the United States for college. As a black African in America, Adichie was suddenly confronted with what it meant to be a person of color in the United States. Race as an idea became something that she had to navigate and learn. She writes about this in her novel Americanah. She received a bachelor's degree from Eastern Connecticut State University, with the distinction of summa cum laude in 2001.</br>

<br> In 2003, she completed a master's degree in creative writing at Johns Hopkins University. In 2008, she received a Master of Arts degree in African studies from Yale University.

Adichie was a Hodder fellow at Princeton University during the 2005–2006 academic year. In 2008 she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. She was also awarded a 2011–2012 fellowship by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University.</br>

<br> Adichie divides her time between the United States, and Nigeria, where she teaches writing workshops. In 2016, she was conferred an honorary degree – Doctor of Humane letters, honoris causa, by Johns Hopkins University. In 2017, she was conferred honorary degrees – Doctor of Humane letters, honoris causa, by Haverford College and The University of Edinburgh. In 2018, she received an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters, from Amherst College. She received an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, from the Université de Fribourg, Switzerland, in 2019.</br>

<br>In an interview published in the Financial Times in July 2016, Adichie revealed that she had a baby daughter. In a profile of Adichie, published in The New Yorker in June 2018, Larissa MacFarquhar wrote, "the man she ended up marrying in 2009 was almost comically suitable: a Nigerian doctor who practiced in America, whose father was a doctor and a friend of her parents'. Adichie is a Catholic and was raised Catholic as a child, though she considers her views, especially those on feminism, to sometimes conflict with her religion. At a 2017 event at Georgetown University, she stated that religion "is not a women-friendly institution" and "has been used to justify oppressions that are based on the idea that women are not equal human beings." She has called for Christian and Muslim leaders in Nigeria to preach messages of peace and togetherness.</br>

<br> In 2017 Adichie was criticized by some as transphobic, initially for saying that "my feeling is trans women are trans women." Adichie later further clarified her statement, writing "that there is a distinction between women born female and women who transition, without elevating one or the other, which was my point. I have and will continue to stand up for the rights of transgender people." Adichie expressed concern that the trans debate is being used as an excuse to take away freedom of speech by labeling and aggressively trying to silence people who may not agree with trans activism, and that the trans movement wishes an erosion of women as a political and biological class.</br> 

<br> In 2020, she weighed into "all the noise" sparked by Rowling's article on sex and gender, and defended Rowling's essay as being "a perfectly reasonable piece". She again faced criticisms, some of which came from Nigerian author Akwaeke Emezi, who had graduated from Adichie's writing workshop.

Adichie criticised cancel culture, saying: "There's a sense in which you aren't allowed to learn and grow. Also forgiveness is out of the question. I find it so lacking in compassion." </br>

<h3> Writing Career</h3>
<p>Ngozi Adichie's original and initial inspiration came from Chinua Achebe, after reading his 1958 novel "Things Fall Apart," at the age of 10; Adichie was inspired by seeing her own life represented in the pages. She has also named Buchi Emecheta as a Nigerian literary precursor, on whose death Adichie said: "Buchi Emecheta. We are able to speak because you first spoke. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your art. Nodu na ndokwa."

<br>Adichie published a collection of poems in 1997 (Decisions) and a play (For Love of Biafra) in 1998. She was shortlisted in 2002 for the Caine Prize for her short story "You in America", and her story "That Harmattan Morning" was selected as a joint winner of the 2002 BBC World Service Short Story Awards. In 2003, she won the O. Henry Award for "The American Embassy", and the David T. Wong International Short Story Prize 2002/2003 (PEN Center Award). Her stories were also published in Zoetrope: All-Story, and Topic Magazine.</br>

<br>Her first novel, "Purple Hibiscus" (2003), received wide critical acclaim; it was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction (2004) and was awarded the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book (2005). Purple Hibiscus starts with an extended quote from Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart</br>

<br>Her second novel, "Half of a Yellow Sun" (2006), named after the flag of the short-lived nation of Biafra, is set before and during the Nigerian Civil War. Adichie has said of Buchi Emecheta's "Destination Biafra" (1982): "[It] was very important for my research when I was writing "Half of a Yellow Sun." "Half of a Yellow Sun" received the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. "Half of a Yellow Sun" was adapted into a film of the same title directed by Biyi Bandele, starring BAFTA award-winner and Academy Award nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor and BAFTA winner Thandie Newton, and was released in 2014.</br>

<p><br>Adichie's third book, "The Thing Around Your Neck" (2009), is a collection of 12 stories that explore the relationships between men and women, parents and children, Africa and the United States.</br>

<br>In 2010 she was listed among the authors of The New Yorker's "20 Under 40" Fiction Issue. Adichie's story "Ceiling" was included in the 2011 edition of The Best American Short Stories.</br>

<br>Her third novel "Americanah" (2013), an exploration of a young Nigerian encountering race in America was selected by The New York Times as one of "The 10 Best Books of 2013".</br>

<br>In April 2014, she was named as one of 39 writers aged under 40 in the Hay Festival and Rainbow Book Club project Africa39, celebrating Port Harcourt UNESCO World Book Capital 2014.</br>

<br>Adichie's short story, "My Mother, the Crazy African" discusses the problems that arise when facing two cultures that are complete opposites from each other. On one hand, there is a traditional Nigerian culture with clear gender roles, while in America there is more freedom in how genders act, and less restrictions on younger people. Ralindu, the protagonist, faces this challenge with her parents as she grew up in Philadelphia, while they grew up in Nigeria. Adichie dives deep into gender roles and traditions and what problems can occur because of this.</br>

<br>In 2015, she was co-curator of the PEN World Voices Festival.</br>

<br>In a 2014 interview, Adichie said on feminism and writing: "I think of myself as a storyteller but I would not mind at all if someone were to think of me as a feminist writer... I'm very feminist in the way I look at the world, and that world view must somehow be part of my work."</br>

<br>In March 2017, "Americanah" was picked as the winner for the "One Book, One New York" program, part of a community reading initiative encouraging all city residents to read the same book.</br>

<br>In April 2017, it was announced that Adichie had been elected into the 237th class of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the highest honours for intellectuals in the United States, as one of 228 new members to be inducted on 7 October 2017.</br>

<br>Her most recent book, "Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions", published in March 2017, had its origins in a letter Adichie wrote to a friend who had asked for advice about how to raise her daughter as a feminist.</br>

<br>In 2020, Adichie published Zikora, a stand-alone short story about sexism and single motherhood.</br></p>
